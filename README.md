Hotel Recommendation Model Using Visitor Status and Sentiment Analysis

Abstract: 

After conducting an in-depth analysis of the data gaining valuable insights, we decided to shift our focus to developing a model that predicts suitable hotels for visitors based on their marital status (single or married). We utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and verify positive and negative reviews before feeding them into the model, ensuring high-quality input data. 

The entire project was implemented using PySpark.
